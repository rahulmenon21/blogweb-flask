        <p class="intro">Customer experience (CX) is the impression you leave with your customers, which results in how
            they think of you as a brand and ultimately creates brand loyalty. Measuring this process with customer
            experience metrics is important if you want to boost customer retention.</p>

        <p class="firstpara">Metrics can help you improve your practices to cater to the customer experience. Solving
            problems for customers quickly can make it 2.4 times more likely a client will stick with your business.
            Lowering the customer effort score (CES) by providing simple, easy-to-use products and services means 76% of
            customers are more likely to recommend your brand to others.</p> <br>

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>What is customer experience?</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Customer experience (CX) is the journey or amalgamation of interactions a customer or potential customer has
            with a business. This starts with the moment a client becomes aware of a business and follows the purchasing
            process. Plus, CX includes the weeks, months, or even years later that a customer uses a product or service.
            <br><br>

            Businesses may work hard to get a customer in the door to make a purchase, but it's important to look at the
            whole picture. That might mean providing support to customers, even years down the line. <br><br>

            Why is this extra effort and money worth it to the business? It costs more money to add a new customer than
            to retain an existing one, and 32% of people globally say they'd ditch a brand they love after just one bad
            experience. <br><br>

            If you're ready to create remarkable experiences for your customers, check out the below episode of the
            "Duct Tape Marketing Podcast" hosted by the HubSpot Podcast Network to find out how to do just that.

        <p class="thirdpara">
            Surveys, journey maps, and a variety of other metrics are necessary for measuring CX. This process is
            complex and can span several years for some customers. <br><br>

            Customer service is just one part of the equation. You want clients to have positive reactions to your
            advertising and marketing efforts. They should have an easy time using your products or services. And they
            should get quick responses from your team. <br><br>

            Surveys are one of many ways to measure CX, and we'll dive into specific surveys that help measure customer
            experience in a few. You may send out surveys after a customer makes a purchase or interacts with your
            support line. You might survey clients for feedback on a new product or service. Engaging with customers
            through surveys can help you get an idea of your business strengths and areas where you can improve.

        <p class="fourthpara">
            CX metrics are the key to effectively measuring the customer experience. You can use a combination of
            surveys, retention and churn rates, and customer trend data to determine how satisfied your customers are at
            every step of the journey — and whether or not they're willing to come back or refer your brand to others. <br><br>

            Start measuring CX so you can make the business improvements necessary to retain more clients and generate
            more revenue.
