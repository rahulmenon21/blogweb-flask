        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>What is workforce management?</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Workforce management (WFM) is a system of processes that organizations employ to reduce costs and increase
            productivity by managing their employees in the workforce. This process often involves creating and
            maintaining staff schedules, accounting for employees' paid time off, and syncing their time with payroll
            for disbursement. <br><br>

            Implementing workforce management provides insight into the day-to-day operations of your employees. It can
            provide more detail into an individual's abilities. It can reveal staff members who consistently show up on
            time or late. <br><br>

            As highlighted in the image below, workforce management is an efficient system that integrates a network of
            multiple components to promote a thriving, successful workforce.

        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>Why is workforce management important?</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            Consider the workforce back in February 2020. Now, remember how it changed once the COVID-19 shutdowns began
            happening? <br><br>

            It was impossible to anticipate the pandemic response or predict how long it would last. However, the
            importance of workforce management stands out in a situation like this. <br><br>

            Although forecasting would be difficult, workforce management allows you to keep track of staffing and
            scheduling. It's a system that enables you to make real-time adjustments as circumstances change. The
            established guide for the people, processes, procedures, and technology that workforce management creates
            will make your company more adaptable and resilient.

        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>Workforce Management Components</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            There are many divisions in workforce management. When you have a team of employees, there's more involved
            than your employees simply showing up to work and your business paying them. <br><br>

            The system you have in place needs to cover the significant components of workforce management, including:
            <br>

            1. Scheduling <br><br>
            2. Time Tracking <br><br>
            3. Forecasting and Budgeting <br><br>
            4. Artificial and Assistive Intelligence <br><br>
            5. Attendance Management <br><br>
            6. Compliance <br><br>
            7. Payroll and Benefits
        </p>
        <br>

    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>Scheduling</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            When dealing with an entire team, manually scheduling your staff can lead to problems. You have to consider
            employee availability, vacation schedules, skill sets, and more. Poor schedule management can lead to
            understaffing, unexpected absences, and over-budget labor costs due to overstaffing. <br><br>

            Workforce management scheduling software helps mitigate these issues. We'll discuss software options in more
            detail shortly. <br><br>

            But a lot of software provides real-time visibility into staffing levels to help limit understaffing and
            overstaffing. It optimizes shifts based on demand, availability, and seniority. Overall, the scheduling
            feature of workforce management programs enables your company to adequately manage your employees, their
            time, and the budget for compensating them.
