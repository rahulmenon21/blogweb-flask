        <hr>
        <p class="intro">One acronym you might have read about while researching customer data platforms is RFM. It
            stands for "Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value," and analyzing these data points can provide you with a
            fuller picture of your customer base.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="firstpara">
            RFM is a strategy for analyzing and estimating the value of a customer, based on three data points: Recency
            (How recently did the customer make a purchase?), Frequency (How often do they purchase), and Monetary Value
            (How much do they spend?).
        </p> <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>How to Calculate RFM</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            <b> Step 1: RFM Scoring </b> <br>
            RFM analysis classifies customers with a numerical ranking for each of the three categories, with the ideal
            customer earning the highest score in each of the three categories. This is known as RFM <scoring
                class="br"><br></scoring>

            For example, depending on the purchase cycle of your company's product or service you might evaluate
            customers for recency on a scale of 1-10, with a score of 10 indicating the customer had made a purchase
            from your company within the last month, and a score of 1 indicating that their last purchase was 10-12
            months prior.

        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>Step 2: Run an RFM Analysis</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            Once a company has decided on its 1-10 scale for each of the three categories, it can review its CRM and
            give each customer a score for each category. Then, by adding up the three combined scores, companies can
            run an RFM analysis to determine which companies are most likely to buy again soon, and use that information
            to prioritize how they're reaching out to and creating value for those high-value customers.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>Step 3: Crystalize customer communications.</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            It's important to note that, while an RFM analysis can provide a quick snapshot of which customers have
            purchased most recently to prioritize nurturing and loyalty efforts, it doesn't necessarily mean they want
            to hear all of your offers, all the time. Make sure you still have a clear system in place for customer
            communication so they aren't constantly getting bombarded with emails and calls from your colleagues. That
            could alienate them, and eventually make them switch to a competitor. High RFM analysis scores should be a
            signal to learn from a customer, rather than to try to sell more to them right off the bat.

        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>An RFM Analysis to Grow Your Customer Base</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            An RFM analysis is simply a tool to give you an idea of how much of your revenue comes from repeat customers
            vs. new customers, and which levers you can pull to try to make customers happier so they become repeat
            purchasers. Your company's RFM analysis might indicate that customers aren't satisfied with your product or
            service after their initial purchase, or that customers who are upsold or cross-sold are more likely to
            purchase again than other customers. <br><br>

            An RFM analysis helps you find commonalities and differences between customers who repeat purchases and
            customers who don't to help you learn where there are gaps in your customer experience. <br><br>
