        <hr>
        <p class="intro">Knowledge managers have a critical role in a company's storage and distribution of information.
            These professionals also oversee the company's knowledge management system (KMS), which creates a central
            source of truth for company information.</p>

    <div>
        <p class="firstpara">Data silos make accessing crucial information difficult and can hold the whole organization
            back. To overcome these limitations, consider adding a knowledge manager to your team.</p> <br>

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>The Knowledge Manager's Role</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Knowledge managers ensure that everyone has access to the knowledge base. Every employee should have access
            to the data they need to perform their jobs. <br><br>

            Often, a company has multiple knowledge managers overseeing different parts of the business. Data-driven and
            information-heavy departments can benefit most from having a knowledge manager on their team. That includes
            IT, research and development, product, engineering, and operations. <br><br>

            Even departments like human resources or customer service can find value in having a knowledge manager. This
            dedicated professional can help keep training materials, onboarding documents, and policy guides organized.

        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>What does a knowledge manager do?</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            A knowledge manager plays a key role in the way a company's data, processes, and knowledge are organized.
            Without this role, information can end up siloed. This may potentially prevent employees and key
            stakeholders from getting access to the resources they need. <br><br>

            Knowledge managers ensure that the knowledge base is kept up-to-date and compartmentalized in a way that's
            easy to navigate. They also document insights that employees wish to contribute and record information about
            a company's products or processes. <br><br>

            A knowledge manager must be efficient, communicative, and organized to succeed in this role.

            If you're looking to hire a knowledge manager or want to see if this role is a fit for you, start by
            exploring a knowledge manager's job description. Responsibilities include: <br><br>

            1. Designing, developing, and managing programs related to knowledge management. <br><br>
            2. Deploying training, communications, and awareness programs related to knowledge management. <br><br>
            3. Identifying ways to improve the current knowledge management system. <br><br>
            5. Developing new programs and solutions that meet the needs of the department. <br><br>
            6. Collaborating with team members to capture new information that can be stored in the knowledge base.
            <br><br>
            7. Maintaining the knowledge management system or platform (website, CMS, LMS, etc.). <br><br>
            8. Conducting evaluation strategies to gauge knowledge program effectiveness and return on investment. This
            can
            include metrics collection, analysis, and reporting. <br><br>
            9. Encouraging a knowledge-sharing culture across the organization.

            No one career path will guarantee you a job as a knowledge manager. Often, people in this role have
            experience as technical writers, project managers, or program managers. <br><br>

            Experience in human resources may also be helpful. You may be tasked with organizing training material or
            knowledge related to HR processes.
