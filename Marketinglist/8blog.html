        <hr>
        <p class="intro"> As a marketer, you’re always on the hunt for more leads. However, building the best lead
            generation strategy involves an in-depth understanding of tried-and-tested channels. Then, you’ll need to
            find the most effective combination of tactics for your unique goals.

    <div>
        <p class="firstpara"> In this post, you’ll gain insights into each major channel for B2B lead generation,
            including social media, PPC, blogging, and email. Best of all, you’ll learn effective strategies and
            impressive real-world examples for each. </p> <br>

    <div>
        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i> What is B2B lead generation? </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara"> B2B lead generation is the process of bringing prospective customers to your
            organization. These leads should be potential buyers who would benefit from your business’ product or
            service. <br><br>

            The types of leads generated vary by campaign and marketing platform. Disciplined B2B marketers understand
            the different dynamics, budgets, and expectations typical of each lead generation channel. </p> <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i> Social Media Marketing Strategies </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara"> Social media is a critical component of B2B marketing. Social media marketing is typically
            less expensive than traditional advertising costs and offers broad mileage. In fact, 44% of marketers
            identified social media as their top channel for acquiring new customers, according to 2022 HubSpot
            Research. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i> What is the conversion rate in PPC lead generation? </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara"> Adwords conversion rates fall around 2.41% for B2B companies, according to 2021 data from
            WordStream. Meanwhile, display conversion is averaged at 0.77%. However, rates vary depending on your
            industry. <br><br>

            It’s important to know your industry benchmarks. A good starting point is to ask each PPC vendor for their
            average conversion ratio across the board. This lets you evaluate your campaign results better. <br><br>

            Should PPC replace organic marketing? No — they complement each other. For instance, many high-value keyword
            searches have only PPC ads above the fold like this. </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i> Blogging Lead Generation Strategies </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara"> Blogging is at the core of content marketing. This strategy focuses on creating content
            that is interesting or valuable to your defined audience. The goal is to attract and sustain online
            engagement for leads down the road. <br><br>

            A lot has been said about the benefits of business blogging. Let’s reiterate the major benefits. </p>
