        <hr>
        <p class="intro"> Affiliate marketing on Instagram works the same as other platforms, where a business pays
            someone (i.e., an influencer) a commission for attracting people to purchase its product or service. The
            amount of commission paid is tracked through a unique code or URL. </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <img src="../Mimages/2img.jpg" alt="" width=""> <br><br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p class="firstpara"> Instagram used to have a native program for creators, but it ended in August of 2022. Not
            to worry, though, because you can still make money from affiliate marketing on Instagram. This post will
            discuss how and give examples of creators that successfully use the strategy. </p> <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="secondhead"> 1. Switch to a creator or business account. <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara"> An important step, although not required, is to have a creator or business account on
            Instagram. <br><br>

            When you have this designation on your account, it establishes your legitimacy with your followers and the
            businesses you choose to work with. You’ll be seen as a trusted source that is not trying to run a scam or
            make a quick profit. </p> <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="thirdhead"> 2. Find affiliate partners or businesses that you want to work with. <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara"> To start affiliate marketing on Instagram, you need to find an affiliate program you want
            to work with. Amazon Associates is an excellent example of an affiliate program, where you can earn a
            commission between 1 and 10% based on the product category. <br><br>

            Another option is to reach out to businesses directly that you’d like to work with and explain how you
            relate to what they offer and the potential your audience has to bring them. <br><br>

            Businesses might also reach out to you directly to start an affiliate partnership, which brings back the
            importance of having a business profile or creator account to establish your legitimacy. </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> 3. Choose products relevant to your niche and the type of content you create. <i> </i>
        </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara"> When finalizing your partnerships, ensure you choose products or services that relate to
            your niche, audience, and the content you already create. For example, if you’re a technology creator,
            partnering with a beauty brand does not align with the influence and content you create. <br><br>

            It’s also essential to have trust in the products, businesses, or services you recommend. If your audience
            follows through with a purchase because of your recommendation and experience with the product and it
            doesn’t work as advertised, you can lose the trust with your audience that you worked hard to build.
            <br><br>

            It’s a best practice to try products or services yourself beforehand to ensure the partnership is worthwhile
            for all involved. </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> Over to You <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara"> Affiliate marketing helps you drive revenue, develop relationships with your favorite
            brands or businesses, and bring value to your audiences, so it’s a worthwhile strategy to consider when it
            comes to driving loyalty and engagement on the platform. </p>
