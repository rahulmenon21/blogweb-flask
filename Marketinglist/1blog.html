        <hr>
        <!-- <p class="intro"> </p> -->
    </div>

    <div>
        <img src="/1blog" alt="" width="20%"> <br><br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p class="firstpara"> With thousands of Instagram marketing tools to choose from, how do you know which ones you
            need? </p> <br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="secondhead"> 1. Social Monitoring <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara"> Hubspot’s social media management software allows you to create “streams.” These are
            dedicated pages for monitoring conversations on a specific social media platform. <br><br>

            Streams can be set up to track and trigger alerts for brand mentions, relevant keywords, and even your
            competitors. <br><br>

            For example, a competitor stream can be set up to track the performance of a competitor's Instagram content
            and campaigns. This means that within your dashboard you will have a dedicated “stream” that tracks your
            competitors' top posts. <br><br>

            You can use this dashboard to analyze what's working for your competitors based on engagement. To provide
            even more insight, Hubspot will flag posts that a competitor has likely paid to spread beyond their organic
            social following as “Likely Boosted.” </p> <br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="thirdhead"> 2. Content Sharing <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara"> Hubspot’s social software allows you to publish content directly from your dashboard in
            three ways: immediately, at a set time, or on a default schedule that you can customize down to the minute.
            <br><br>

            Alternatively, you can use Hubspot’s “publish like a human feature” which can automatically vary the times
            your posts. <br><br>

            Let's say you don’t want to go into your dashboard at all, Hubspot also offers a “social Chrome extension.”
            With this feature, you can schedule and publish social content right from your browser.
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> 3. Attribution <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara"> Hubspot allows you to tag your social content as marketing assets and associate them with
            relevant marketing campaigns. This means that you can then directly attribute social posts to user actions
            on your website. Measuring the impact of your Instagram campaigns on lead generation becomes easy. <br><br>

            For example, a dashboard called the “New Contacts Report” shows you the number of new contacts created in
            HubSpot as a result of social-media-driven web sessions. <br><br>

            Best for: Content and campaign management <br><br>

            Pricing: Included in the professional plan of the Marketing Hub, which starts at $45/month.F </p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> What Users Say <i> </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara"> “HubSpot makes all aspects of my job easier. The tools and systems they have constructed
            are easy to use, implement, and utilize. … I can swiftly schedule posts to go out at any time of day and the
            data they collect is immensely helpful in analyzing the performance of our campaigns,” Laura D on G2.
            <br><br>

            “I'm not particularly tech-savvy, but I find their layout processes easy and there are lots of handy guides
            for when I get stuck.
