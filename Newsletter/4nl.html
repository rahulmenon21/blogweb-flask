        <p class="intro">
            In recent years, the subjects and photographers behind some of the internet’s most popular memes have taken
            legal action to protect their work from nefarious actors.
        </p>

            The image depicts a toddler smugly clenching his fist on a beach. In meme form, it’s typically overlaid with
            a caption describing an unexpected triumph like not getting spaghetti sauce on a white shirt, or finding a
            $20 bill in an old jacket. <br><br>

            It’s been shared tens of millions of times, and in endless variations, bringing collective joy to the
            internet. <br><br>

            But this past week, Success Kid was at the epicenter of a thoroughly humorless legal battle in an Iowa
            courtroom. <br><br>

            The drama began back in 2020, when a staff member for the far-right Iowa politician Steve King decided to
            use the Success Kid meme in a fundraising drive for his reelection campaign. <br><br>

            What King’s team failed to realize is that Success Kid is a copyrighted asset. They hadn’t secured
            permission to use it, or responded to a cease-and-desist letter. <br><br>

            This landed King in court, where he faced thousands of dollars in damages and a mountain of legal fees.

        <p class="secondpara">
            Success Kid and most other famous memes generally meet the three requirements to qualify for copyright
            protection in the US: <br><br>

            1. An original work of authorship <br><br>
            2. A minimal level of creativity <br><br>
            3. Fixed in a tangible form of expression <br><br>
            Despite this, scholars have pointed out that the legal doctrine and meme culture are often at odds with one
            another: <br><br>

            1. Copyright law is designed to prevent copying at all costs. <br><br>
            2. Memes, conversely, depend on copying to achieve success. <br><br>
            A meme can only become a meme through untethered virality, which usually entails widespread copyright
            infringement. <br><br>

            “Memes are like organisms: They’re born, then proliferate across the internet with extreme speed,” says Don
            Caldwell, the editor-in-chief of Know Your Meme, a database of internet phenomena. “They need to replicate
            at scale to survive.”

        <p class="thirdpara">
            On a cloudy day in 2007, Laney Griner took her 11-month-old son, Sam, to a Florida beach and snapped a photo
            of him trying to eat a handful of sand. She uploaded the shot to Flickr and forgot about it. <br><br>

            But the internet found it — and Success Kid was born. <br><br>

            Over time, the photo spread widely, and not always in ways that Griner approved of. So, she registered a
            copyright and set out to protect her son’s image. <br><br>

            In 2015, Griner filed suit against Jake’s Fireworks, a company that was using the Success Kid image on the
            box of one of its products. The case was settled for unspecified financial damages, and Jake’s was forced to
            destroy its unsold inventory. <br><br>

            “[W]e’re not questioning the right of Internet users to use this,” said Griner’s attorney at the time. “This
            is more about a company making our client a de facto endorser of an age-inappropriate product.”

            Success Kid is managed by Ben Lashes (real name: Ben Clark), the world’s preeminent “meme talent agent.” <br><br>

            The 44-year-old ex-musician helps creators of viral content “protect, brand, monetize, and stay cool
            forever.”
