        <p class="firstpara">At the outset of the Depression, Charles Mitchell was the most wanted banker in America.
            Today, his name’s largely been forgotten.</p> <br>

    <div>
        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>Around noon on one of the worst days in the history of Wall Street, Charles E.
                Mitchell hurried up the steps of the House of Morgan, a two-story gray building across from the New York
                Stock Exchange. <br><br>

                It was Oct. 24, 1929, and disaster had struck. When the market opened, stocks plummeted so fast the
                exchange’s ticker tape couldn’t keep up with the frenzy. <br><br>

                The news was particularly dismaying to Mitchell. Renowned as the “ideal modern banking executive,” he
                had reshaped the very idea of American banking as head of National City Bank and helped fuel the 1920s
                bull market, which was now in jeopardy. <br><br>

                Inside the House of Morgan, Mitchell and bankers J.P. Morgan Jr., Thomas Lamont, and Albert Wiggin
                decided to go on a stock-buying spree to inject confidence into investors. The momentum spread at the
                exchange and, miraculously, the market stabilized. </i> </h2> <br>

            Most mornings in New York City during the Roaring ’20s, Charles Mitchell could be spotted on the sidewalks
            of Manhattan on his way to work. <br><br>

            Despite being one of the wealthiest men in New York City, Mitchell walked nearly five miles from his Fifth
            Avenue mansion to the financial district. His doctor had recommended more fresh air, and the long walks —
            along with open-water swims — gave him endurance for 12-hour workdays.

            A portrait of Charles Mitchell in 1923 (Library of Congress) <br>

            This aura of discipline had been part of Mitchell’s persona since his childhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts.
            In a letter to the local newspaper, he once excoriated his high school’s battalion team for not practicing
            hard enough. <br><br>

            But Mitchell never questioned his own bona fides. He later characterized a story of how his father bought
            him a pony — the most privileged gift a child can receive — as a test of his work ethic. <br><br>

            “If you want a pony, you must be its groom,” he recalled his father saying. <br><br>

            In 1916, National City Bank, known today as Citigroup, hired Mitchell to head its new investment banking
            affiliate, National City Company. City Bank had specialized in commercial banking, mostly for the wealthy,
            but was then branching into the sale of securities.

        <p class="fourthpara">
            The foundation of the soaring stock market was built on a couple of questionable strategies propagated by
            City and other investment banks. <br><br>

            1. Margin loans: Many traders bought stocks for ~10% of the cost, borrowing the remaining money with
            interest
            from brokers (who represented banks). In the early 1920s, ~$1B was invested on margin annually, according to
            John Kenneth Galbraith’s The Great Crash 1929, a number that increased to ~$6B in 1928. <br><br>
            2. Investment pools: Similar to pump-and-dump schemes, banks held exclusive stock offerings at a low buy-in.
            They would make the stock available to the general public at a higher price, allowing the bankers and their
            elite partners to sell their shares for a quick profit.

        <p class="fifthpara">
            On February 21, Mitchell took a seat in room 301 of the Senate office building, preparing to face a barrage
            of questions from the Senate Subcommittee on Banking and Currency, helmed by appointed counsel Ferdinand
            Pecora. <br><br>

            Pecora was no grandstanding politician. He was a cigar-smoking, fedora-wearing New York City prosecutor who
            liked to call the bank executives “banksters” because he saw them as finance gangsters.
