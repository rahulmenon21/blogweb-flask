        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>The invention of the original nacho</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            At a Texas Rangers baseball game, the voice of a concession stand employee cuts through the din of the upper
            deck concourse. <br><br>

            “Another ballpark nacho,” she yells. <br><br>

            A co-worker grabs a plastic receptacle, opens a metal vat containing a molten substance, and hands the
            container to the cashier. The treat arrives in all its gooey glory: crunchy tortilla chips, drizzled in
            golden-orange cheese sauce — jalapeño slices to top it off.

        <p class="thirdpara">
            Liberto was a self-described “bald peanut-peddler” who ran a family food business, the Liberto Specialty
            Company. (Today it’s called Ricos.) His grandfather, Rosario, immigrated from Sicily in the early 1900s,
            settling in San Antonio and opening a downtown food store in 1909. <br><br>

            The store imported Italian coffee and olives, but the company’s most successful venture was peanuts, sold at
            circuses and local festivals. At the Battle of Flowers Parade in 1921, Rosario hung a sign outside his cart
            that read “400,000 pounds sold.” <br><br>

            The company passed on to Rosario’s son Enrico and then to Enrico’s son, Frank Liberto. Liberto made popcorn
            and snow-cone syrups and turned the company into a one-stop shop operation at stadiums and movie theaters by
            adding janitorial services, seeking any edge for the business.

        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>Finding the right cheese</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            The Liberto family drove southwest from San Antonio into Mexico. Hours later, after a paved highway turned
            into a dirt road, they arrived somewhere outside Monterrey. <br><br>

            There was no hotel, no resort, recalled his son Tony Liberto in an interview with The Hustle, just fields of
            neatly ordered crops belonging to the company La Costeña.

        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>An immediate sensation</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            For the first season in 1976, Tony Liberto helped build several red-and-white striped carts and shipped them
            up to Arlington Stadium. <br><br>

            Workers heated the cheese with electric roasters and ladled it onto the tortilla chips, sprinkling jalapeños
            on top. A dish of nachos sold at the stadium for $1.25, or ~$6.60 today, with a profit margin of ~80%. <br><br>
