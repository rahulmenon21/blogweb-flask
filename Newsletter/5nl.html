        <p class="intro">
            A typical agent in the US closes on 10 homes in a year. One record-setting agent in Texas does better than
            that nearly every day.

            Try to picture the top-selling real estate agent in the world. <br><br>

            Are you thinking of a New Yorker in a skyscraper who has befriended a bunch of investment bankers? Perhaps a
            shady Londoner steering oligarchs to multimillion-dollar mansions? <br><br>

            Whoever you’re imagining, it’s probably not someone like Ben Caballero. <br><br>

            Little about Caballero’s aesthetic screams world-class: The slight 83-year-old works out of a nondescript
            building in suburban Dallas. His office is outfitted with gray carpeting and drop ceiling tiles. He shares
            the building with a waste management company.

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>Slow beginnings</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Caballero’s real estate career seemed destined to fail before it really got started. <br><br>

            In 1960, he moved to Dallas on a whim: His car had broken down on a trip from Oklahoma City to Houston, and
            he liked the friendly people who helped him on the road so much that he decided to stay forever. <br><br>

            Caballero was 21, fresh out of the Air Force, recently married, and had ~$500 to his name.

        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>Inventing a new sales system</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            Caballero exploited an odd quirk in the way new houses get marketed and sold. <br><br>

            1. Homebuilders generally just want to build houses and don’t care as much for the work of selling them.
            They’re rarely tech savvy, and they don’t often see eye to eye with agents, who find that builders are
            desperate in cold markets but avoid their calls in hot markets. <br><br>

            2. Real estate agents generally don’t understand nuances of new homes, like how delays alter closing dates
            or
            that new homes have more complex contracts than existing homes. They also like to work with their own
            lenders, another turnoff for builders.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>The next big idea</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            Caballero is aware he likely won’t break his 2020 world record anytime soon, given reduced buyer demand in
            the face of rising interest rates and a decline in housing starts, which had ticked up to their highest
            level in more than a decade at the heights of the pandemic. <br><br>

            But his business still has appeal in sluggish real estate markets. <br><br>

            According to Hoodwin, the Caballero client with Altura, builders might be more likely to use him when demand
            is lower. The market was so hot last year that many builders, including Altura, didn’t use real estate
            agents. (Caballero’s sales in 2021 fell to a pedestrian 4.7k.)
