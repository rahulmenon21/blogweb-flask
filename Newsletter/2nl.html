            How one of America’s last piano manufacturers stays alive

            Inside an old brick building in the leafy town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, you’ll find one of the last
            vestiges of a once-formidable industry. <br><br>

            Entering the six-story structure is like going back in time: Stacks of kiln-dried maple wood line the walls.
            Artisans carefully tinker with tuning pins and soundboards. A light tinkling of classical music rises above
            the whir and putter of 100-year-old machines. <br><br>

            Not long ago, piano factories like this were one of America’s largest and most formidable industries,
            employing tens of thousands of workers.

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>The golden age of the piano</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Until the late 1700s, the majority of pianos were built in Europe, first in Vienna, and later in Great
            Britain. <br><br>

            But by the turn of the 18th century, pianos had made their way to the US — and soon, a burgeoning
            manufacturing industry emerged in industrial hubs like New York and Boston. <br><br>

            William Hettrick, a professor of music at Hofstra University, told The Hustle that hundreds of piano makers
            popped up throughout the mid- to late-1800s. Chief among them:

        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>The bust</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            In the 1920s, a confluence of factors dragged piano sales down: <br><br>

            1. The commercialization of automobiles opened up new avenues for entertainment outside of the home.
            <br><br>
            2. The commercialization of radio created a competing source of entertainment inside the home. <br><br>
            3. The stock market crash of 1929 tanked disposable income. <br><br>
            During the ensuing Great Depression, piano sales virtually fell off a cliff. Between 1929 and 1931: <br>

            1. The number of pianos sold fell from 350k+ to less than 60k units per year
            2. Total US piano sales declined from $42m to $15m
            3. 85% of piano workers were laid off

        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>A comeback</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            In 1996, an entrepreneur named Kirk Burgett saw an opportunity to revive one of the US’s last piano
            manufacturers. <br><br>

            A decade earlier, Burgett and his brother had invented PianoDisc, a device that enables a piano to play
            itself for guests. The company grew rapidly and sold 120k units to customers including Nancy Pelosi, Bill
            Gates, and pro sports stars. <br><br>

            Burgett caught wind that Mason & Hamlin, one of the preeminent piano manufacturers of the golden age, was up
            for purchase in bankruptcy court. <br><br>

            “We just decided to take a risk and save it,” Burgett told The Hustle during a recent visit to the company’s
            Haverhill factory. <br><br>

            When Burgett bought Mason & Hamlin, it was a “husk.” <br><br>

            “The creditors gutted the building of inventory,” says Burgett. “We didn’t get a single piano out of it.”

    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>And then there were two</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            Today, Mason & Hamlin is one of just two remaining piano manufacturers in the US that are currently active.
            The other is Steinway. <br><br>

            While Steinway enjoys a more prominent brand and a larger market share, Mason & Hamlin is boutique,
            producing around 2.5 pianos per week. <br><br>

            Though the production process is now more efficient, it still takes the company up to 9 months to build a
            concert grand piano, which retails for $175k. <br><br>

            “There’s really no shortcut to the process,” says Lagomarsino, Mason & Hamlin’s EVP.
