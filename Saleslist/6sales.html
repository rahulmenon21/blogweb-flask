        <hr>
        <p class="intro">Running a retail business feels more complicated today than ever before. To survive in a
            competitive market, brands have to outshine their competitors and reach their customers where they are. This
            can be a challenge — that is, if you don’t have an optimized distribution strategy.

        <p class="firstpara">Today, consumers expect to interact with brands via many channels. They want to buy
            in-store, via a company site, third-party platforms, and even social media. An optimized distribution
            strategy will help you figure out the right way to reach them, and in this article, we’ll guide you through
            how to do just that.</p> <br>

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i> Types of Distribution Strategy </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            An optimized sales distribution strategy is one tailored to your brand and customers. You don’t have to
            choose from a limited number of prescribed alternatives. There are, however, three categories into which
            most strategies fall:

    <div>
        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i> 1. Intensive Distribution Strategy </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            Many brands adopt this type of plan. It involves implementing as many different channels as possible for a
            given product. The most notable advantage is that this enhances market penetration for the product. It can
            be an expensive choice, however.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i> 2. Selective Distribution Strategy </i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            This strategy is when firms choose different channels for specific products or services. They might, for
            instance, only sell an item in a particular geographic area. Or they may restrict sales of product lines to
            only their website. The idea here is to match channels to consumer behavior and demand. That, thus, is more
            cost and time-efficient for the brand.
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>3. Exclusive Distribution Strategy</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            Companies may restrict the provision of some items even more. They could, for instance, use only one very
            narrow channel for a particular line. When brands use this tactic, they’re trying to stoke scarcity and thus
            demand. It’s how companies make products seem higher-end and more desirable.
