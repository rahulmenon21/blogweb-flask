        <p class="intro">A one-size-fits-all approach generally isn’t as appealing as a personalized experience. This
            can be true for the merchant as well as the consumer. If you are selling tickets to a concert, for instance,
            having a cheaper general admission ticket and a more expensive VIP treatment ticket would probably suit you
            best.

        <p class="firstpara">This is an everyday example of price tiering that gives the seller more opportunities to
            convert leads and the buyer more options to fit the experience and price they desire. </p> <br>

        <h2 class="secondhead"> <i>What is tiered pricing?</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="secondpara">
            Merchants who offer a variety of pricing plans or packages to their prospects are likely operating on a
            tiered pricing model. Tiered pricing offers customers a variety of prices — each based on certain features,
            benefits, or services. These tiers allow customers to choose the option that best accommodates their needs
            and often incentives them to move up in tiers over time.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="thirdhead"> <i>Tiered Pricing Examples</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="thirdpara">
            Most price tiering models have three different tiers that range from some version of "basic" to "plus."
            Sometimes, tiers can vary so much that they have different target audiences — think "personal" vs.
            "business" packages. <br><br>

            Tiered pricing models work especially well with memberships, event tickets, and services — but they can also
            be applied to a much wider range of industries.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fourthhead"> <i>Essentials</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fourthpara">
            This introductory tier offers the most basic level of benefits. Sometimes this tier acts more as an
            incentive for new customers to start engaging with your business than a long-term option. Other times, it
            offers enough to meet some customers’ needs on an ongoing basis without making them feel like they’re
            overspending on a non-critical purchase.
        </p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 class="fifthhead"> <i>Standard</i> </h2> <br>
        <p class="fifthpara">
            The medium-level tier should appeal to your average customer or the widest audience, making it the most
            common choice. It generally includes what is offered in the lower tier and expands on it. The standard
            benefits should offer a clear understanding of what your business has to offer.
